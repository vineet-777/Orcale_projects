# ML Demo - Iris Flower Classification 🌸

This project is a **beginner-friendly machine learning demo** using the famous **Iris dataset**.  
It demonstrates how to load a dataset, preprocess it, train a model, evaluate performance, and make predictions.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Load Dataset** – Reads `iris.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.  
2. **Data Exploration** – Basic statistics and visualization of the dataset.  
3. **Preprocessing** – Splits the data into training and testing sets.  
4. **Model Training** – Uses a simple classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression / Decision Tree).  
5. **Evaluation** – Checks accuracy and generates a classification report.  
6. **Prediction** – Makes predictions on sample inputs.
